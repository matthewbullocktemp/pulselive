# Technical Test

Technical Test for Pulselive

## Getting Started

Clone repo to local environment.

Run npm install.

Run npm update.

Run npm start.

### Next Steps

I would create my own nodejs/express backend that would serve an api behind a proxy, rather than hosting the json through a third party.

I would host images on a cloud service i.e AWS S3 to ensure scalability, as you would not want to host too many images on the server.
