Technical Test for Pulselive

## Getting Started

Clone repo to local environment.

Run npm install.

Run npm update.

Run npm start.

### Improvements/Extension of code

I would create my own nodejs/express backend that would serve an api behind a proxy.

I would host images on a cloud service i.e AWS S3 to ensure scalability.
